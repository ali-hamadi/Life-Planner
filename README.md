# Life-Planner
This Project was my first attempt at creating an Android app (while using my very old Samsung S1 for testing purposes).

## ABSTRACT

The role of smartphones is increasingly becoming an important and vital part of our lives. Our daily activities that were once recorded on hardcopies (phonebooks and grocery lists) have now shifted into the smartphone domain for convenience. Similarly, I believe the role of agendas and planners can be transferred to the smartphone, which is what this project aims to achieve. Life Planner is a light-weight Android application that combines the functions of an alarm application and note application, essentially creating an agenda/planner for the smartphone. Users can add, update or delete tasks, as well as customize the application’s visual settings. Only the tasks of the current day are listed on the main screen. This is to show only the tasks that are immediately relevant to the user and keep the interface clutter-free. Life Planner also includes a feature that allows users to view a list of the tasks set on any day, similar to a calendar.

As of late 2015, Google officially ended support for the Android Developer Tools (ADT) plug-in in Eclipse. As a result, I recently migrated my project from Eclipse to Android Studio and made some necessary code changes to keep my project intact after the transition.
